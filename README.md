# PHP

QetriX Framework in PHP 7.

Minimal version
---------------

* **libs**
  * qmodule.php
  * qpage.php
  * util.php
* **modules**
  * [module].php
* **vars**
  * **logs**
* qetrix.php

In this configuration, the whole framework has just 75 kB (1600 lines of code). All classes are regular, there's no "lite" version. QetriX is designed to be highly extensible, so even such integral parts, like components, are optional.
