# PHP

QetriX Framework in PHP 7.

Minimal version
---------------

* **libs**
  * qmodule.php
  * qpage.php
  * util.php
* **modules**
  * [module].php
* **vars**
  * **logs**
* qetrix.php

In this configuration, the whole framework has ~80 kB (~2000 lines of code). All classes are regular, there's no "lite" version. QetriX is designed to be highly extensible, so even such integral parts, like components, are optional.
