In multi-app mode, directory /apps contains source code and graphics files for QetriX applications.
Each app has its own dir. Its name is URL encoded, but using small caps ASCII letters, numbers and underscores only is highly encouraged.

When converting to single-app instance, copy contents of the app dir to destination single-app QetriX root directory. There's no /apps directory in single-app mode.
